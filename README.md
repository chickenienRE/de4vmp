Description
===========

a fully static devirtualizer for vmp, works for versions 3.4, and early 3.5

Usage
===========

1. if target has anti-tamper, dump it via ks-dumper (https://github.com/EquiFox/KsDumper)
2. demutate with demutation (https://github.com/xlfj5211/DeMutation)
3. drag n drop into devirtualizer

Common errors
===========

* if demutatiton fails, anti-tamper is propably still present
* if devirtualizer fails, its either new version or the file is corrupted

Disclaimer
===========

* I made it a long time ago, left no comments so don't ask me how it works, neither do I know
* thanks to washi and rtn community
